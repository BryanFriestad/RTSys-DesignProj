TaskGen v1.0 - by Paul Emberson <paule -at-domain- rapitasystems.com>
======================================================================
This is a Python script for generating task-sets for multi-processor
systems with Roger Stafford's randfixedsum algorithm. It requires the
numpy library (http://numpy.scipy.org/). It has been tested with
Python 2.6.5 and numpy 1.4.1 and also Python 2.7 and the latest svn of
numpy (as showing up on July, 12th).


There isn't any documentation for the software either. However, if you
type taskgen.py --help then you will get an insightful help message.


Compile
======================================================================
This software is a Python script and does not need to be compiled.


Install
======================================================================
Just type 'make' in order to see the available install options.


License
======================================================================
Type 'taskgen.py --about'.


note some code has been edited by me, Isaac. An example for running this with desired properties of the paper is to run:
python taskgen.py -n 5 -p 5 -q 100. Which generates 5 task sets with period ranging from 5 to 100, and total utalization of .75.
