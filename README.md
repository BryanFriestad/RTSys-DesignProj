# RTSys-DesignProj
Final design project for Computer Engineering 458/558: Real Time Systems. The project is a simulation study comparing the overhead efficiency of two multiprocessor scheduling algorithms. Specifically, we will be comparing the RUN (Reduction to UNiprocessor) and P-Fair algorithms.
